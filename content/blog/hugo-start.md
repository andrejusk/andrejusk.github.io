Most articles start off by boring you with
why you should get your own website.
The gist of it really boils down to **control**.

Creators showcase some of their best content in their online portfolio.
There are plenty of services that allow content sharing,
but nothing quite matches the flexibility of a custom website.

Software engineering goes a step further -
your website _is_ part of your portfolio.
It's a chance to concentrate a lot of work into 
a small self-contained space on the world wide web,
and a great opportunity to explore new
tech that you'd otherwise not touch,
kind of like [Hackathons](https://mlh.io).

I've had a personal website for a while now,
and it's always been an online copy of my business card.
It was written in raw HTML/CSS and _based_ on a template.

There are plenty of services online offering
"the all-in-one solution for anyone 
looking to create a beautiful website."
Although they are perfectly good for what they do,
they'd feel like cheating for an engineer.
