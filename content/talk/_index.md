This section contains the talk
proposals I have prepared and available.
Additionally, there's a list of talks
and workshops I've given to date.

I'm more than happy giving talks at meetup groups.
If you'd like me to come along
to your event as a speaker,
reach out to me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrejusk/),
