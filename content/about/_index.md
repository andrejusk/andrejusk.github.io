Hey! As of {{ .date }}, I am a [BSc Computer Science](http://www.reading.ac.uk/computer-science/) 
finalist at the [University of Reading](http://reading.ac.uk). 
I work part-time as a Design & Development Engineer at [Think Engineer](http://think-engineer.com), 
where I specialise in leveraging Cloud for IoT applications.

In the little free time I have, I am an active member of local tech communities and co-organise [GDG Reading](https://meetup.com/GDG-Reading-Thames-Valley/) events as well as run [R. U. Hacking?](https://ruhacking.me) 18 / 19, where
I am also part of the [GitHub Campus Experts](https://githubcampus.expert/andrejusk/) programme.

Shoot me an email over at **{{ .your.name }}  {{ "@" }} {{ .this.domain }}** to get in touch - 
every email gets forwarded to my main inbox, where I can get back to you.
