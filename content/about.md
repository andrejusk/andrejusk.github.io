Hey! As of {{ .date }}, I am a [BSc Computer Science](http://www.reading.ac.uk/computer-science/) 
finalist at the [University of Reading](http://reading.ac.uk), UK. 
I work part-time as a Design & Development Engineer at [Think Engineer](http://think-engineer.com), 
where I specialise in leveraging Cloud for Internet of Things (IoT) 
applications. This has led to my [dissertation](https://github.com/iowine) being based in IoT.

Before University, I undertook the [International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme](https://ibo.org/) in Lithuania, 
which earnt me a bilingual diploma. Amongst my chosen subjects, I had Mathematics and 
Computer Science at Higher Level, and I also wrote my Extended Essay in Computer Science as well.

In the little free time I have, I actively engage with the local tech community by volunteering 
as a co-organiser for [Google Developer Group Reading & Thames Valley](https://meetup.com/GDG-Reading-Thames-Valley/) and as well as running 
the [Reading University Hacking](https://ruhacking.me) society.
