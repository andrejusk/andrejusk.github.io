Hey! As of {{ .date }}, I am a [BSc Computer Science](http://www.reading.ac.uk/computer-science/) 
finalist at the [University of Reading](http://reading.ac.uk). 
I work part-time as a Design & Development Engineer at [Think Engineer](http://think-engineer.com), 
where I specialise in leveraging Cloud for IoT applications.

In the little free time I have, I am an active member of my local tech community and co-organise [GDG Reading](https://meetup.com/GDG-Reading-Thames-Valley/) events as well as run [R. U. Hacking?](https://ruhacking.me) 18 / 19.

If you'd like to get in touch, shoot me an email over at **[your name] [at] [this domain]**, 
it'll get forwarded to my main inbox and I can get back in touch with you.
